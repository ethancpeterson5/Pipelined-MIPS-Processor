# Project2 for Computer Organization and Assembly Level Programming 

First, we created a multi-cycle MIPS processor which works completely correctly. 
Then, we made it pipelined which caused some problems as our hazard detection did not work entirely correctly. Jump and Branch Instructions caused errors that we could not fix. 
All the other instructions which did not cause control hazards worked correctly and the processor properly forwarded the data if instructions caused data hazards.
